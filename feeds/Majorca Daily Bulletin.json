In immersing myself in the very recent<strong> history of the Soller Valley I find we are very compliant these days.</strong> Is this because Europe has a say in the rules or is it that the politicians want to please those who complain the loudest? For instance, let’s take the main road between the Tunnel and the Port. One side of the road, for some of the route, is a cycle path and a space for people to walk. It has become, by default, a car park. The rules of the road apply, and it would not be unusual to see a ticket on those cars for a parking contravention. This is not the case as its now assumed and accepted that cars can park there as there is nowhere else for them.</p>\r\n<p>Let’s go to the back of the Port on the Repic side. In the past the restaurant and bars in that area stayed open most of the night, <strong>shutting around 6am at weekends before tidying up and starting all over again.</strong> I am describing the world around 40 to 50 years ago. Now the restaurants choose to close when the customers dry up. Sometimes this can be 10pm or slightly later in the season. A real late-night bar is hard to find these days. This is not the ‘rules’ that make this happen but the choice of the businessperson running the establishment. Covid recovery still hangs in, with locals and visitors not being the ‘late birds’ they once were. They have got used to that extra bit of TV and Netflix and often stay home, when in the past, they would have gone out.</p>\r\n<p>This week in Soller, the annual rental the bars and restaurants must<strong> pay for their terraces was announced.</strong> The Town Hall does well out of renting the pavement. The business chatter says this is all well and good but most of the time they are half empty. The discussions will go on about this and decisions will be made.</p>\r\n<p>This is all about the accounts and the spread sheets. Is this business viable with the numbers and how much is spent each night? This is the question in view of the early night preference.<br>The stories of Soller and the Port being <strong>‘open all hours’</strong> are remembered by the older generation and the visitors who have been coming here for many years.</p>\r\n<p>They think the young have gone soft! To come out of the door at midnight in Soller and not see another soul is weird for them.</p>\r\n<p>The <strong>Tardeo movement</strong> has something to do with all this. The move towards dining, drinking, and meeting up with friends, starting late afternoon, is happening all over Mallorca, especially at weekends. 5 pm has become the new 11 pm, is the word on the street. Difficult to know if this culture is here to stay or whether more covid recovery time is needed to go back to how it was.</p>\r\n<p>The exception to the Tardeo crowd is those who want to dance after dinner.<strong> They still have a problem in the Soller Valley.</strong> Those venues are currently hard to find. The weekend use of the late buses into Palma come into their own for these friends. They then plan their return in the early hours by taxi. This is also a shout out to all would be dancers about the venues open on the industrial estates. Some great vibes coming out of Son Castello including Judge Jules on 17th June. This is the over 40’s reliving their rave days. It’s all here in Mallorca but you need to be in the know to track it all down.</p>\r\n<p>Rules, exceptions, and co-existence do their best here and develop all the time.<strong> New politicians</strong> ready for four years of work might make some inroads on this and we wait for the ideas and the practicalities to start jumping out.</p>",

Covid recovery still hangs in, with locals and visitors not being the ‘late birds’ they once were. They have got used to that extra bit of TV and Netflix and often stay home, when in the past, they would have gone out.\n\r\nThis week in Soller, the annual rental the bars and restaurants must pay for their terraces was announced. The Town Hall does well out of renting the pavement. The business chatter says this is all well and good but most of the time they are half empty. The discussions will go on about this and decisions will be made.\n\r\nThis is all about the accounts and the spread sheets. Is this business viable with the numbers and how much is spent each night? This is the question in view of the early night preference.\nThe stories of Soller and the Port being ‘open all hours’ are remembered by the older generation and the visitors who have been coming here for many years.\n\r\nThey think the young have gone soft! To come out of the door at midnight in Soller and not see another soul is weird for them.\n\r\nThe Tardeo movement has something to do with all this. The move towards dining, drinking, and meeting up with friends, starting late afternoon, is happening all over Mallorca, especially at weekends. 5 pm has become the new 11 pm, is the word on the street. Difficult to know if this culture is here to stay or whether more covid recovery time is needed to go back to how it was.\n\r\nThe exception to the Tardeo crowd is those who want to dance after dinner. They still have a problem in the Soller Valley. Those venues are currently hard to find. The weekend use of the late buses into Palma come into their own for these friends. They then plan their return in the early hours by taxi. This is also a shout out to all would be dancers about the venues open on the industrial estates. Some great vibes coming out of Son Castello including Judge Jules on 17th June. This is the over 40’s reliving their rave days. It’s all here in Mallorca but you need to be in the know to track it all down.\n\r\nRules, exceptions, and co-existence do their best here and develop all the time. New politicians ready for four years of work might make some inroads on this and we wait for the ideas and the practicalities to start jumping out.",

      "content": "<p>Juan Bauça is Santa Margalida’s grand demon. He is not a demon of the fire-running variety. He doesn’t even wear a mask, for <strong>Juan is demon-in-chief</strong> when Santa Catalina Thomàs (La Beata) walks the gauntlet of the pot-smashing demons at the September fiestas.</p>\r\n<p>When he takes time off from being a demon, what does he do? Well, more than three years ago, prior to the pandemic, he and three others - not necessarily demons but aficionados at the very least of demonic culture - came up with the idea of <strong>creating a hotel in Santa Margalida village</strong>. The municipality has a whole load of hotels - they’re all in Can Picafort except for a couple of rural ones - but it doesn’t have an interior hotel in Santa Margalida itself. Juan and friends decided to do something about this. And as lovers of the demonic underworld, they also decided to give it a demon theme.</p>\r\n<p>The aim is that <strong>S’Arracer del Dimoni will open in spring 2024</strong>. So it will be more than four years since the project began to take shape. Why so long? They had the property to convert, but - and apart from Covid - they ran up against all the bureaucracy for a project of this type. In all, it took two years and ten months to get the paperwork sorted out. Planning permission was one aspect, but another - and somewhat more problematic - was obtaining the registrations for the beds.</p>\r\n<p>Tourist accommodation places haven’t been easy to come by. For hotels, they can be bought from the government’s consortium for accommodation places, but this requires places at other hotels to have been given up. Since February last year, no new places have been available, the outgoing government having adopted this measure to prevent further growth in tourist numbers. For Juan and partners, they <strong>only have eighteen rooms,</strong> so the number of actual beds is low. Even so, they had to wait their turn in being able to buy these places (3,500 euros each) and therefore have the necessary registration. One could say that they had the devil’s own job in getting everything sorted out.</p>\r\n<p>The conversion will maintain some of the old building. Otherwise it will be adapted to current-day needs for a hotel. These include sustainability features such as solar panels which will generate much of the electricity. There won’t be a restaurant, as Juan explains that they want guests to spend in Santa Margalida establishments. The hotel, he hopes, will serve as a <strong>means of giving the local economy a boost</strong>. To this end, it will be open all year, an alternative to all the seasonal sun-and-beach of Can Picafort.</p>\r\n<p>As to the demon theme, Juan and others won’t be racing around smashing pots. The decoration will say it all, e.g. <strong>paintings and photos of Santa Margalida demons</strong>, whose role in the La Beata procession has existed ever since the first (believed to have been in 1792, when Catalina Thomàs was beatified) and which managed to overcome an attempt by the Bishop of Mallorca to ban the demons in the mid-nineteenth century.</p>\r\n<figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://md.gsstatic.es/sfAttachPlugin/128401.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" width=\"880\" height=\"495\">\r\n<figcaption>Partido Popular’s Fina Linares (centre) will be the next mayor of Alcudia, following the pact reached with Vox and Unió per Alcúdia.</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n<h4>Town halls and the bad blood of pacts</h4>\r\n<p>If coalitions are needed to form town hall administrations after elections, and they normally are needed, the <strong>resulting alliances can create some bad blood</strong>.

She is from Sant Joan and we began visiting regularly in 2010 and then, in 2014, we decided to move to Mallorca, set up a small language academy and I became a ‘Sant Joaner’,” he said.</p>\r\n<p>“Sant Joan, despite being relatively small, has such a <strong>dynamic community</strong>. I’ve never known anywhere with so many associations - there are at least 20 - be these for the young or the elderly, culture, sports. You name it, everyone is involved with something and there’s always something going on. Before I knew it I became a member and a councillor for the local Assemblea per Sant Joan party four years ago. We realised that people we’re not all that happy but we needed a stronger platform if we were really going to make a difference, so before Christmas we began talking to Més and the party gave us its blessing to run on their ticket for mayor in order to try and get into a position to be able to change the village for the better and we won five out of the total eleven council seats.</p>\r\n<p>“The five councillors were two more than in the previous elections, when the party obtained three councillors. Més won 142 more votes. In 2019 Més ran together with the local group Assemblea per Sant Joan.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Urgent short-term matters</strong><br>“For his part, the current mayor, Francesc Mestre, of El Pi has dropped two councillors and has only obtained three representatives, which distances him from the majority he was on the verge of obtaining in 2019 after getting 229 fewer votes. The PP has managed to maintain its two councillors and the PSIB has also kept its only councillor.<br>“So we managed to form a pact with the Socialists and on Saturday I will be sworn in as mayor for the next three years.</p>\r\n<p>“Some of us are aware that there are many simple actions to improve Sant Joan that are urgent in the short term, while others will take longer and will need funding and grants from the Council of Mallorca. We will obviously have to see how the formation of the main administrations eventually take place.</p>\r\n<p>“That said, the team and I intend to <strong>break the mould of ‘traditional local government’</strong>. I mentioned the associations, they are the lifeline of the local community, so they are going to play an important role and we’ve singled out 12 main areas we believe need attention and improvement such as health, education, sustainability, traffic and roads and senior citizens.</p>\r\n<p><strong>12 areas of vital importance</strong><br>“We’ve selected areas of vital importance and we are going to approach them all as a team; no single person is going to be responsible for any particular area.<br>“I want to get rid of the old rigid approach to local councils and create a more inclusive approach, one of collaboration and distributive leadership. <br>“We ran a very positive election campaign and want that positivity to continue and, if it is in the best interests of the people of Sant Joan, I will talk to opposition parties, apart from Vox if I can help it; that’s what I mean by inclusive.<br>“One thing I have learnt since the elections is that there are many people who voted for us at a local level but voted for the Partido Popular or even Vox at a regional level.</p>\r\n<p><img src=\"https://md.gsstatic.es/sfAttachPlugin/128329.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1066\"></p>\r\n<p><strong>Wanting the best</strong><br>“One thing is wanting the best for the local community, the other is what people want for the Balearics and expect from the main administrations - the Balearic government and the Council of Mallorca. So, based on that, I need to keep an open mind and put Sant Joan first.</p>\r\n<p>“As a geographer and having been in charge of field studies on the mainland, my expertise will be channelled into mobility, roads and local transport, for example. <br>“I will be working on projects to encourage more people to walk or cycle and reduce the dependency on cars and the need for huge car parks.</p>\r\n<p>“And we have a very young and talented team. I’m the eldest by far at 52, plus we have a very good and close working relationship with the Socialists. And my former colleagues from the Assemblea are on hand to give me any advice I may need,” Robert said.</p>\r\n<p>“But <strong>I am extremely proud to have been elected mayor</strong>. I think it’s testimony to the people of Sant Joan and how open minded they are - to have a foreigner running the town hall.<br>“Yes, Sant Joan is a very cosmopolitan multicultural community. The head of the primary school told me they havestudents from some 20 different nationalities, which I think is great; it brings more colour to the community. We’ve got people from the mainland, the UK, Germany, Holland, Scandinavia and Japan, for example, and that enriches life, especially when everybody is working and living together in such a lively community,” Richard explained, although he admitted that he is aware of some foreign communities in other parts of the island who are concerned and worried about the further emergence of the far-right party Vox.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Not a ‘sound bite’ politician</strong><br>“I have to admit, and my wife is a journalist, I’m not a ‘sound bite politician’, but I know what my team and I believe in and we know what the people of Sant Joan expect. I will have an open-door policy prepared to confront any problems facing the local community.<br>“We have a few Airbnbs, some excellent rural hotels and agroturism hotels around us, but we’re not on the main cycle routes like other neighbouring municipalities in the Pla such as Petra or Sineu, but we also have a few famous and first-class restaurants which are very popular with residents and locals alike, so we’re off the main tourism beat if you like.</p>\r\n<p>“That said, we believe in responsible tourism and getting the right balance. We’re open for business, obviously we all need to make a living and for Mallorca tourism is very much the key. But we’re certainly not moving towards a tourism boom by any means.<br>“We’re a small municipality off the beaten track and that is one of the great attractions of Sant Joan and I’m convinced that the majority of people would like to keep it that way. I think it’s one of the main reasons foreign residents have moved into the area. They want to experience the very best of rural Mallorca and its traditions and, as I’ve said, there’s never a dull moment in Sant Joan,” Richard stressed.</p>\r\n<p>“In the meantime, I’ve also got to sit down and perfect my Catalan. <br>“I know I should have done more in Barcelona, but one member of the team is from Valencia and when she talks in Valencian that throws me as well. Plus there’s the matter of dialects and accents. TV Catalan can be quite removed from Mallorcan in the villages, although I’m told I do have a Sant Joan accent. All the more reason for feeling so humbled to have being elected and the least I can do is brush up on my Catalan as quickly as possible,” Richard said.<br>He’s certainly got his work cut out.</p>",

I mentioned the associations, they are the lifeline of the local community, so they are going to play an important role and we’ve singled out 12 main areas we believe need attention and improvement such as health, education, sustainability, traffic and roads and senior citizens.\n\r\n12 areas of vital importance\n“We’ve selected areas of vital importance and we are going to approach them all as a team; no single person is going to be responsible for any particular area.\n“I want to get rid of the old rigid approach to local councils and create a more inclusive approach, one of collaboration and distributive leadership. \n“We ran a very positive election campaign and want that positivity to continue and, if it is in the best interests of the people of Sant Joan, I will talk to opposition parties, apart from Vox if I can help it; that’s what I mean by inclusive.\n“One thing I have learnt since the elections is that there are many people who voted for us at a local level but voted for the Partido Popular or even Vox at a regional level.\n\r\n\n\r\nWanting the best\n“One thing is wanting the best for the local community, the other is what people want for the Balearics and expect from the main administrations - the Balearic government and the Council of Mallorca. So, based on that, I need to keep an open mind and put Sant Joan first.\n\r\n“As a geographer and having been in charge of field studies on the mainland, my expertise will be channelled into mobility, roads and local transport, for example. \n“I will be working on projects to encourage more people to walk or cycle and reduce the dependency on cars and the need for huge car parks.\n\r\n“And we have a very young and talented team. I’m the eldest by far at 52, plus we have a very good and close working relationship with the Socialists. And my former colleagues from the Assemblea are on hand to give me any advice I may need,” Robert said.\n\r\n“But I am extremely proud to have been elected mayor. I think it’s testimony to the people of Sant Joan and how open minded they are - to have a foreigner running the town hall.\n“Yes, Sant Joan is a very cosmopolitan multicultural community. The head of the primary school told me they havestudents from some 20 different nationalities, which I think is great; it brings more colour to the community. We’ve got people from the mainland, the UK, Germany, Holland, Scandinavia and Japan, for example, and that enriches life, especially when everybody is working and living together in such a lively community,” Richard explained, although he admitted that he is aware of some foreign communities in other parts of the island who are concerned and worried about the further emergence of the far-right party Vox.\n\r\nNot a ‘sound bite’ politician\n“I have to admit, and my wife is a journalist, I’m not a ‘sound bite politician’, but I know what my team and I believe in and we know what the people of Sant Joan expect. I will have an open-door policy prepared to confront any problems facing the local community.\n“We have a few Airbnbs, some excellent rural hotels and agroturism hotels around us, but we’re not on the main cycle routes like other neighbouring municipalities in the Pla such as Petra or Sineu, but we also have a few famous and first-class restaurants which are very popular with residents and locals alike, so we’re off the main tourism beat if you like.\n\r\n“That said, we believe in responsible tourism and getting the right balance. We’re open for business, obviously we all need to make a living and for Mallorca tourism is very much the key. But we’re certainly not moving towards a tourism boom by any means.\n“We’re a small municipality off the beaten track and that is one of the great attractions of Sant Joan and I’m convinced that the majority of people would like to keep it that way. I think it’s one of the main reasons foreign residents have moved into the area. They want to experience the very best of rural Mallorca and its traditions and, as I’ve said, there’s never a dull moment in Sant Joan,” Richard stressed.\n\r\n“In the meantime, I’ve also got to sit down and perfect my Catalan. \n“I know I should have done more in Barcelona, but one member of the team is from Valencia and when she talks in Valencian that throws me as well. Plus there’s the matter of dialects and accents. TV Catalan can be quite removed from Mallorcan in the villages, although I’m told I do have a Sant Joan accent. All the more reason for feeling so humbled to have being elected and the least I can do is brush up on my Catalan as quickly as possible,” Richard said.\nHe’s certainly got his work cut out.",

While we usually set intentions at a new moon, we might want to hold off on launching big plans for now. We may be too foggy to handle things effectively. On a positive note, this could be a good day to spend time with family, do home-related chores or indulge in some self-pampering. Working on creative ideas or engaging with art can be fulfilling as well.</p>\r\n<p><strong>ARIES</strong><br><em>(March 21 to April 19)</em><br>You don't need to put any more activities on your calendar right now. What you need is a relaxing day at home or some quality time with family.</p>\r\n<p><strong>TAURUS</strong><br><em>(April 20 to May 20)</em><br>Try not to stress about the future or something that may be temporarily out of your reach. Reframe any negative thoughts. Make a list of the positives in your life.</p>\r\n<p><strong>GEMINI</strong><br><em>(May 21 to June 20)</em><br>You might not be feeling super confident today. Think about some of the qualities that you appreciate about yourself and keep them at the forefront of your mind.</p>\r\n<p><strong>CANCER</strong><br><em>(June 21 to July 22)</em><br>Who and what inspires you? You're encouraged to seek them out, especially if you're feeling melancholy or anxious. Doing good for others can also raise your vibration.</p>\r\n<p><strong>LEO</strong><br><em>(July 23 to Aug. 22)</em><br>Don't be so quick to make yourself available to folks. You'll do a lot better enjoying some quiet time alone.</p>\r\n<p><strong>VIRGO</strong><br><em>(Aug. 23 to Sept. 22)</em><br>Be mindful of who you decide to team up with or the new commitments you take on. Make sure the opportunity is the right fit for you.</p>\r\n<p><strong>LIBRA</strong><br><em>(Sept. 23 to Oct. 22)</em><br>Before you jump to the next project or idea, make sure to complete what you've already started. If you're starting something new, take the process slowly.</p>\r\n<p><strong>SCORPIO</strong><br><em>(Oct. 23 to Nov. 21)</em><br>If you're on the fence about a romantic interest or you sense something's up with your partner, talk about it. An honest conversation can clear the air.</p>\r\n<p><strong>SAGITTARIUS</strong><br><em>(Nov. 22 to Dec. 21)</em><br>Avoid overextending yourself to people. Be a bit more protective of your heart, energy or resources.</p>\r\n<p><strong>CAPRICORN</strong><br><em>(Dec. 22 to Jan. 19)</em><br>Things may not go according to plan today. You could end up feeling like you're going in circles. Maybe that's your cue to go and have some fun or ask for some backup.</p>\r\n<p><strong>AQUARIUS</strong><br><em>(Jan. 20 to Feb. 18)</em><br>Don't undersell your talent. Your time and skills are valuable. Meanwhile, giving a little love to your home space can support your well-being.</p>\r\n<p><strong>PISCES</strong><br><em>(Feb. 19 to March 20)</em><br>You're encouraged to do something self-affirming today. Put yourself out there by doing something bold. Take a creative risk or experiment with your personal style.</p>\r\n<h4>FOR TODAY'S BIRTHDAY</h4>\r\n<p>You're tough as nails, but you're also sentimental and sweet. You work hard, and you love hard, too. No matter what happens in life, you'll stick by the people you love and weather the storms with them. You're perceptive, innovative and consistent.

While we usually set intentions at a new moon, we might want to hold off on launching big plans for now. We may be too foggy to handle things effectively. On a positive note, this could be a good day to spend time with family, do home-related chores or indulge in some self-pampering. Working on creative ideas or engaging with art can be fulfilling as well.\n\r\nARIES\n(March 21 to April 19)\nYou don't need to put any more activities on your calendar right now. What you need is a relaxing day at home or some quality time with family.\n\r\nTAURUS\n(April 20 to May 20)\nTry not to stress about the future or something that may be temporarily out of your reach. Reframe any negative thoughts. Make a list of the positives in your life.\n\r\nGEMINI\n(May 21 to June 20)\nYou might not be feeling super confident today. Think about some of the qualities that you appreciate about yourself and keep them at the forefront of your mind.\n\r\nCANCER\n(June 21 to July 22)\nWho and what inspires you? You're encouraged to seek them out, especially if you're feeling melancholy or anxious. Doing good for others can also raise your vibration.\n\r\nLEO\n(July 23 to Aug. 22)\nDon't be so quick to make yourself available to folks. You'll do a lot better enjoying some quiet time alone.\n\r\nVIRGO\n(Aug. 23 to Sept. 22)\nBe mindful of who you decide to team up with or the new commitments you take on. Make sure the opportunity is the right fit for you.\n\r\nLIBRA\n(Sept. 23 to Oct. 22)\nBefore you jump to the next project or idea, make sure to complete what you've already started. If you're starting something new, take the process slowly.\n\r\nSCORPIO\n(Oct. 23 to Nov. 21)\nIf you're on the fence about a romantic interest or you sense something's up with your partner, talk about it. An honest conversation can clear the air.\n\r\nSAGITTARIUS\n(Nov. 22 to Dec. 21)\nAvoid overextending yourself to people. Be a bit more protective of your heart, energy or resources.\n\r\nCAPRICORN\n(Dec. 22 to Jan. 19)\nThings may not go according to plan today. You could end up feeling like you're going in circles. Maybe that's your cue to go and have some fun or ask for some backup.\n\r\nAQUARIUS\n(Jan. 20 to Feb. 18)\nDon't undersell your talent. Your time and skills are valuable. Meanwhile, giving a little love to your home space can support your well-being.\n\r\nPISCES\n(Feb. 19 to March 20)\nYou're encouraged to do something self-affirming today. Put yourself out there by doing something bold. Take a creative risk or experiment with your personal style.\n\r\nFOR TODAY'S BIRTHDAY\n\r\nYou're tough as nails, but you're also sentimental and sweet. You work hard, and you love hard, too. No matter what happens in life, you'll stick by the people you love and weather the storms with them. You're perceptive, innovative and consistent.

      "content": "<h4>Arenal under siege</h4>\r\n<p>When you think about it, there is something distinctly odd, not to say wrong, about a local authority feeling the need to fence off its beach to prevent tourists from going onto it.<strong> Spanish students, it perhaps need reminding, are tourists.</strong> They fall into that classification of tourist branded by excess, but such is their reputation that they are deemed capable of exceeding the excess more typically associated with, for example, young Britons in Magalluf or young Germans in Playa de Palma. The reason why is because there are that many of them at any given time and in a given place. Arenal in Llucmajor tops the list of places. It is here where the beach will be fenced off at night until the last student has returned to the mainland some time in the first fortnight of July. It's as if Arenal has been preparing for a siege, a ridiculous situation and one that should raise serious questions as to why it is allowed to happen.</p>\r\n<p>The first batches of students arrived last weekend, looking forward to some days of partying and not very much sleep. Fair enough. They're young, the great majority of them - one imagines - away on holiday without their parents for the first time. They're in Mallorca for fun, but this doesn't remove the bad taste of the sense of siege.</p>\r\n<figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://md.gsstatic.es/sfAttachPlugin/128295.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"El Consistorio lidera las acciones para afrontar los viajes de estudios en sÂ¿Arenal\" width=\"730\" height=\"487\">\r\n<figcaption>As one student put it, she'll be resting after she returns from Mallorca</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n<h4>The Bedlam of resorts</h4>\r\n<p>Their holidays last no longer than four nights. Any longer and they would probably suffer from sleep deprivation. As one student put it, she'll be resting after she returns from Mallorca. Tour operators organising the trips are said to be making their <strong>student clients sign forms acknowledging their liabilities in the event of breaches of local laws.</strong> One sanction for misbehaviour is being thrown out of hotels, a measure that is apparently commonly applied to another tourist excess classification - young Germans heading to Arenal in contributing to turning the resort into a Bedlam that surpasses anything that Magalluf can offer.</p>\r\n<p>Taking advantage of low-cost flights, these tourists often don't bother with the hotel accommodation; they just <strong>grab some sleep on the beach</strong>. Their stays are shorter than the students - 24 hours to 72 hours - and are characterised by one thing above all, getting totally drunk and remaining totally drunk. But as the beach in Arenal has been fenced off, they may have to stagger over the borderline with Palma in order to find an accommodating area of sand.</p>\r\n<figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://md.gsstatic.es/sfAttachPlugin/128291.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" width=\"730\" height=\"500\">\r\n<figcaption>Ladies, show some decorum.</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n<h4>Too much flesh</h4>\r\n<p>So much for quality tourism, talking of which there is also dress code (or the lack thereof). Residents in Paguera posted a photo on Instagram of three female holidaymakers - taken to be German, given that Paguera is a predominantly German resort - <strong>wandering along the sea front with thong bikinis.</strong> From the rear, one could see a substantial display of bare buttock. Well, at least they weren't drunk. In fact, they looked to be stone cold sober. But that's not the point. Ladies, show some decorum. And the same goes for all those who, for instance, feel that is acceptable to enter a supermarket in a state of virtual total undress.</p>\r\n<figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://md.gsstatic.es/sfAttachPlugin/128287.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Llega la ola de calor: se superarÃ¡n los 40 grados en CÃ³rdoba y Sevilla\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1280\">\r\n<figcaption>An all-time high in Mallorca was registered last year - 44.5C in Montuiri</figcaption>\r\n</figure>\r\n<h4>A less hot very hot summer</h4>\r\n<p>Not wearing very much is of course a reality in a Mallorcan summer - it all depends on how little - and the Aemet met agency has informed us that we can expect a \"very hot and humid\" summer. But how hot will very hot be? \"We are not expecting temperatures above 40 degrees,\" observed the Aemet delegate in the Balearics, Maria José Guerrero. Given that the all-time high in Mallorca was registered l<strong>ast year - 44.5C in Montuiri</strong> - the Aemet forecast suggests a less hot very hot summer.</p>\r\n<p>The met agency went on to predict that there will be \"some days of instability\" starting in the second fortnight of August, which was a statement of the obvious, as mid-August is typically when instability (aka unsettled weather) tends to kick in. Just as obvious was the forecast that temperatures are expected to drop and rainfall increase in October. Whoever would have suspected that?</p>\r\n<figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://md.gsstatic.es/sfAttachPlugin/128283.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"MALLORCA. TORNADOS. TORNADOS EN MALLORCA.

It is normally at sea rather than on land. The summer will be wetter, but flooding doesn't seem to be on the cards as rain will mostly be light and of the muddy variety.</p>\r\n<p>A flood of a different type is said to be occurring on the roads of the Balearics, which will have to withstand the pressure of some 85,000 hire cars. Compared with 2022, the association of car-rental firms reckons that there will be between 4,000 and 5,000 more - some slight local flooding then.</p>\r\n<figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://md.gsstatic.es/sfAttachPlugin/128297.jpg\" border=\"0\" alt=\"PALMA.

But it does have the potential for creating a hot summer because of the opposition to Uber. The taxi drivers insist that arrangements are illegal in that there aren't the necessary licences to operate in the four municipalities in which Uber have a presence - Andratx, Calvia, Llucmajor, Palma.

      "contentSnippet": "Arenal under siege\n\r\nWhen you think about it, there is something distinctly odd, not to say wrong, about a local authority feeling the need to fence off its beach to prevent tourists from going onto it. Spanish students, it perhaps need reminding, are tourists. They fall into that classification of tourist branded by excess, but such is their reputation that they are deemed capable of exceeding the excess more typically associated with, for example, young Britons in Magalluf or young Germans in Playa de Palma. The reason why is because there are that many of them at any given time and in a given place. Arenal in Llucmajor tops the list of places. It is here where the beach will be fenced off at night until the last student has returned to the mainland some time in the first fortnight of July. It's as if Arenal has been preparing for a siege, a ridiculous situation and one that should raise serious questions as to why it is allowed to happen.\n\r\nThe first batches of students arrived last weekend, looking forward to some days of partying and not very much sleep. Fair enough. They're young, the great majority of them - one imagines - away on holiday without their parents for the first time. They're in Mallorca for fun, but this doesn't remove the bad taste of the sense of siege.\n\r\n\r\nAs one student put it, she'll be resting after she returns from Mallorca\r\n\r\nThe Bedlam of resorts\n\r\nTheir holidays last no longer than four nights. Any longer and they would probably suffer from sleep deprivation. As one student put it, she'll be resting after she returns from Mallorca. Tour operators organising the trips are said to be making their student clients sign forms acknowledging their liabilities in the event of breaches of local laws. One sanction for misbehaviour is being thrown out of hotels, a measure that is apparently commonly applied to another tourist excess classification - young Germans heading to Arenal in contributing to turning the resort into a Bedlam that surpasses anything that Magalluf can offer.\n\r\nTaking advantage of low-cost flights, these tourists often don't bother with the hotel accommodation; they just grab some sleep on the beach. Their stays are shorter than the students - 24 hours to 72 hours - and are characterised by one thing above all, getting totally drunk and remaining totally drunk. But as the beach in Arenal has been fenced off, they may have to stagger over the borderline with Palma in order to find an accommodating area of sand.\n\r\n\r\nLadies, show some decorum.\r\n\r\nToo much flesh\n\r\nSo much for quality tourism, talking of which there is also dress code (or the lack thereof). Residents in Paguera posted a photo on Instagram of three female holidaymakers - taken to be German, given that Paguera is a predominantly German resort - wandering along the sea front with thong bikinis. From the rear, one could see a substantial display of bare buttock. Well, at least they weren't drunk. In fact, they looked to be stone cold sober. But that's not the point. Ladies, show some decorum. And the same goes for all those who, for instance, feel that is acceptable to enter a supermarket in a state of virtual total undress.\n\r\n\r\nAn all-time high in Mallorca was registered last year - 44.5C in Montuiri\r\n\r\nA less hot very hot summer\n\r\nNot wearing very much is of course a reality in a Mallorcan summer - it all depends on how little - and the Aemet met agency has informed us that we can expect a \"very hot and humid\" summer. But how hot will very hot be? \"We are not expecting temperatures above 40 degrees,\" observed the Aemet delegate in the Balearics, Maria José Guerrero. Given that the all-time high in Mallorca was registered last year - 44.5C in Montuiri - the Aemet forecast suggests a less hot very hot summer.\n\r\nThe met agency went on to predict that there will be \"some days of instability\" starting in the second fortnight of August, which was a statement of the obvious, as mid-August is typically when instability (aka unsettled weather) tends to kick in. Just as obvious was the forecast that temperatures are expected to drop and rainfall increase in October. Whoever would have suspected that?\n\r\n\r\n'Cap de fibló', which is similar to a tornado but rarely as destructive\r\n\r\nFlooding the roads\n\r\nAemet also reckons that there will be \"possible tornadoes\", which one suspects was a slight exaggeration in interpretation of the 'cap de fibló', which is similar to a tornado but rarely as destructive. It is normally at sea rather than on land. The summer will be wetter, but flooding doesn't seem to be on the cards as rain will mostly be light and of the muddy variety.\n\r\nA flood of a different type is said to be occurring on the roads of the Balearics, which will have to withstand the pressure of some 85,000 hire cars. Compared with 2022, the association of car-rental firms reckons that there will be between 4,000 and 5,000 more - some slight local flooding then.\n\r\n\r\nUber have a presence - Andratx, Calvia, Llucmajor, Palma\r\n\r\nUber ok\n\r\nBy contrast to this additional influx of hire cars, the Uber fleet - all of around some fifty vehicles at present - is neither here nor there. But it does have the potential for creating a hot summer because of the opposition to Uber. The taxi drivers insist that arrangements are illegal in that there aren't the necessary licences to operate in the four municipalities in which Uber have a presence - Andratx, Calvia, Llucmajor, Palma. Uber refute this, and meanwhile some taxi drivers are said to be deserting their taxis and signing up with Uber in the anticipation of earning more.\n\r\nThe taxi driver associations believe that it is no coincidence that Uber have arrived in Mallorca so soon after the elections, their suspicion being that new administrations will be more amenable to Uber. Which they may be, but in the meantime checks are being carried out at the airport to ensure that documentation is all in order and that the rules are being observed. Palma police and transport ministry inspectors have been checking various types of transport. On Tuesday, ten fines were issued. None of them were for Uber vehicles.\n\r\n\r\nOne of the three arrested on his arrival at the National Police headquarters\r\n\r\n\"Helping\" tourists at car parks\n\r\nThere has been a suggestion that floods of tourists, German in particular, will be disrupted for a few days because of flight alterations. This is due to NATO's Air Defender 23, described as the alliance's largest air defence exercise ever. It is taking place in three areas of Germany and ends next Friday - some 250 aircraft from 25 countries.\n\r\nWith any luck, tourists who manage to be unaffected by NATO won't run into any issues at car parks in Palma, these issues being of a theft variety. A gang of three were arrested at the Parc de la Mar car park. Two of the three had been \"helping\" baffled tourists when they went to pay. This help extended to observing the PIN numbers that were being entered. They then helped themselves to the tourists' wallets before disappearing in a car driven by the third gang member. Palma and National Police set up a joint surveillance operation and nicked them in the act.\n\r\n\r\nThe terraces of the Llonja want to close at 12.30am instead of the current 11pm\r\n\r\nThe noise of Palma\n\r\nIn Palma, meanwhile, residents have once more being highlighting the problem of noise.
